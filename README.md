This small application will show you information about the stocks that you are interested in and the difference in the current quote with the lowest of the day. That way it determines if it's a good time to invest money or now.

I created this application to practice my skills in React and working with API. I used API from finnhub and I posted this application on Heroku: https://apetrech-stock-market.herokuapp.com/

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
